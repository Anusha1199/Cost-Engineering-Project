# Cost-Engineering-Project
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive cost analysis of electric vehicles (EVs), highlighting the critical factors contributing to their high cost—especially battery manufacturing. Using SEER for Hardware (SEER-H), a top-down parametric estimation tool, the project explores life cycle cost (LCC) modeling, cost estimation methodologies, and strategies for reducing EV manufacturing and operational costs.

The goal is to aid policymakers, manufacturers, and researchers in understanding the cost structure of EVs and exploring feasible pathways to accelerate EV adoption through cost optimization.
